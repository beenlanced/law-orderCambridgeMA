## Project Description

#### Problem

As my employer, Akamai, is headquartered in Cambridge, MA and I am not well versed with the Cambridge area, I wanted to have fun looking at open source data to answer real-world questions about where my co-workers live or work.

#### Proposed Solution

Here, I explored crime stats from Cambridge to answer various questions like what are the top crimes, when do they occur, and where.

Analysis was conducted using `R` statistical code using a `R markdown` (Rmd) notebook and a csv data file of crime data from the Cambridge police.

This work was used for a Machine Learning technical meetup, "Learning Tuesdays", a biweekly talk given by a different member of the Akamai mPulse Data Science team.
