# A2

This repository contains code examples, text files, and other general materials related
to Adaptive Acceleration (A2) Data Analysis Work. <br>

It is a hodgepodge of different topics data analysis tool scripts, 
so be warned. Just pay attention to file names.<br>

Alrighty then, good luck and hope the material can be of use. <br>


## Getting Started

Nothing really fancy here to mention. Just pull files as needed and run the code or
peruse the material for information purposes. <br>


### Prerequisites

You will only need appropriate access to machines, numerical software like 
Julia, R, Python, and Juypter notebooks, and set-up of
possible ssh keys. If you are in the DSWB, these steps are assumed to have occurred
already.<br>

Please go [here](https://git.soasta.com/wiki/dswb/wikis/home) for more information <br>



### Installing

Lucky you.. nothing to install!




## Deployment

No deployment required either!

## Files and other code was built with and using:

* [ATOM](https://atom.io) - Text editor jazzed up with Juno to run Julia
* [DSWB](https://git.soasta.com/) - The Data Science Work Bench code from SOASTA
* [Julia](https://julialang.org) - Julia, the high performance dynamic programming language
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) - Jupyter Notebooks
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The Python Software Foundation
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) - The R project for Statistical Computing

* **AND LOVE :-P**

## Contributing

No real contributions from you are required. Please use this as needed
