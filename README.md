# Law&Order Cambridge

This repository contains code examples, text files, and other general materials related
to an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Cambridge, MA crime statistics. Its intent is 
show how you can have fun looking at open source data to answer real questions about
where you live or work. Here, I explored crime stats from Cambridge to answer various
questions like what are the top crimes, when do they occur, and where. Hope you enjoy! <br>

It is mostly R statistical code information in the form of R markdown 
(RMD) notebook along with html output, and csv (data files. Just pay attention to 
file names and you should be fine.<br>

Alrighty then, good luck and hope the material can be of use. <br>


## Getting Started

Nothing really fancy here to mention. Just pull files as needed and run the code or
peruse the material for information purposes. <br>

You will need the latest R computing code to run the examples and to obtain the relevant 
R libraries pointed out in the code. <br>



### Prerequisites

You will only need appropriate access numerical software like 
R. <br>


### Installing

Just R and maybe R studio or other variant to read the .Rmd file.




## Deployment

No deployment required either!

## Files and other code was built with and using:

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) - The R project for Statistical Computing
* [R-studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) - R Studio

* **AND LOVE :-P**
